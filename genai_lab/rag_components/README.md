# ?? RAG Components

This folder contains the foundational components required to build a full RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.

## Contents

- `02_Data_loader_rag_demo.ipynb` – Preprocessing and loading documents into the RAG pipeline.
- `03_Rag_components.ipynb` – Core components: retriever, embedder, and vector store setup.
- `04_Basic_RAG_implementation.ipynb` – Minimal working RAG pipeline using LangChain.
- `05_Memory_langchain.ipynb` – Integrating conversational memory with RAG and LangChain.

## Purpose

To modularly construct a production-ready RAG system with clean separation between ingestion, retrieval, and generation phases.
